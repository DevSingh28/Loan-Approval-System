# Loan Approval Predictor

This project aims to predict whether a loan application will be approved or rejected based on various factors such as credit score, income, education, and employment status.

## Overview

This Jupyter Notebook utilizes machine learning techniques to analyze a dataset containing information about past loan applications. It then trains a neural network model to predict the likelihood of loan approval for new applicants.

## How to Use

1. **Dataset**: Ensure you have the `loan_approval_dataset.csv` file available. You can find the original file [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1qLcDtJerOzS14P0P2AbuvPp4nxuZstN7).

2. You can download the dataset from [this Kaggle link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/architsharma01/loan-approval-prediction-dataset).

3. **Dependencies**: Make sure you have all the necessary dependencies installed. These include:
   - Pandas
   - NumPy
   - Matplotlib
   - Seaborn
   - Scikit-learn
   - TensorFlow
   
4. **Run the Notebook**: Execute the cells in the `Loan_approval.ipynb` notebook in a Jupyter environment like Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.

5. **Training**: The notebook will preprocess the data, train the neural network model, and evaluate its performance.

6. **Prediction**: You can input the details of a new loan applicant and get a prediction of whether their loan application would likely be approved or rejected.
